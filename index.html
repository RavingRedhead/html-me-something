            <h2>My Asian Trip - 1987</h2>
            <p>
                When I was a kid I sang in a children's choir, The Young Singers of Missouri. Every summer the advanced choirs went on an international tour, usually lasting 2 to 3 weeks. Here are some highlights of our trip when I was 11 years old.

        <h3>1. Hong Kong</h3>

            We had arrived late and were bustled into cabs and then into the hotel, so we did not see much of the city until the next day. We gathered in the lobby and were ready to explore the city. As soon as we stepped out onto the sidewalk we were stunned by
            the, well, everything. Every square inch of the buildings were covered in ads and business signs. There were more people than I've ever seen in one place in my life passing by in a constant stream. There was a nonstop cacophony. It was mind-blowing
            for a bunch of ignorant kids from the midwest.
            <br><br>1987 was the year McDonald's opened their first 24-hour restaurant in Hong Kong. Our choir director decided that would be a good first stop. We were not fans, mostly because we expected it to taste just like home. It really didn't
            because, of course, it was mostly being consumed by non-americans.
            <br><br>That afternoon we all boarded some Chinese junks (boats) and cruised around Hong Kong Bay. The water was full of litter all around the shore because people live and work on these boats and throw their trash overboard. But once we got
            out further it was a gorgeous cruise around the bay. Much of the rest of the time in the city was spent exploring cultural landmarks and running around the hotel bothering the gift store guy.

        <h3>2. Nanjing</h3>

            Nanjing is St. Louis' sister city and so was an important stop for our group. We landed and loaded onto a bus. When we pulled up to the front of the hotel, we saw that they had laid out a red carpet from the road to the hotel entrance and had strung a
            banner across the front of the hotel that said 'Welcome Young Singers of Missouri.' Almost the entire staff was lined up along the carpet applauding. We were very confused. We're just a kid's choir from St. Louis. Did they think we were famous
            for something? Why would anyone care if we were staying any particular place? It was a surreal but amazing experience.
            <br><br>We disembarked the bus receiving the best welcome we could have ever hoped for from anyone. Every single person was lovely and courteos to us. We spent a few days traipsing around the city and meeting wonderful people who catered to
            us in every way. I have many stories of being served a ton of delicious food by people who did not understand anything we said but wanted to make sure we ate well, and of being given nothing but orange soda and warm, watered down Coke, but
            I don't have enough room to outline them all here. If you ask me I will tell you about the Incense Incident at a Buddhist temple.

        <h3>3. Beijing</h3>

            No trip to China would be complete without a stop in Beijing. It is a city filled with beautiful people and beautiful buildings. There were far more people riding bikes and dressed in traditional clothing than I ever would have imagined. I remember waking
            up in the hotel room and looking out the window early in the morning to find groups of people practicing tai chi up and down the alley. The day we boarded a train we found a large group practicing tai chi in front of the station. I don't remember
            a single person who was even slightly unfriendly to us.

            <br><br>Our choir director sumehow got us named as honorary US ambassadors to Beijing and sat through a meeting during which we had no idea why we were there or what was happening, but we were very honored to be a part of it. We were treated
            as esteemed guests. Another surreal yet wonderful event. After leaving the meeting we shared a meal with some dignitaries who believed that it was the thing to do to keep piling food onto a guest's plate when she isn't looking, no matter how
            many times she asks them to stop. I was told it is rude to not finish all of the meal. I ate far too much food that night.
            <br><br>We did have one special performance while we were there, during which we traded performances with a local children's choir. The were amazing and so genial and welcoming of our choir.

        <h3>4. Tokyo</h3>

        <p>
            Tokyo looks exactly as it does in movies and on TV. There's neon and quirky little shops EVERWHERE. People upon people. Courtesy is de rigeur. We spent entire days looking around at everything and never feeling like we saw it all.
            <br><br>The performance I remember the most took place in a TV studio. I don't remember which station, but we were broadcast live on Japanese television. We had been on TV before, but not in a different country. I wish I had a copy of that
            performance.

            <br><br>The trip we took when I was 11 years old was nothing short of mind-opening. It was a chance to experience completely different cultures and I'm grateful to this day that I had true culture shock experiences which expanded my worldview.
